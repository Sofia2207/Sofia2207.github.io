    My favortie book series is <i> Harry Potter </i> by J.K Rowling. It is the first book series that I truly <b> loved </b>, before that I hated reading books. This series changed everything for me though, it showed me the magic that you can discover on pages. I encourage others to read the series, or atleast <i>find a book that you love.</i>
